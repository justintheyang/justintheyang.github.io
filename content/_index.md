Hi, I'm Justin! I'm a data scientist at Signifyd, where I build machine learning models to detect fraud in online orders. 


In 2022, I recieved my undergraduate degree from UC San Diego majoring in Cognitive Science and Mathematics, and minoring in Computational Social Science. There, I served as the lab manager at the [Cognitive Tools Lab](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/) and completed my senior thesis under the mentorship of [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/people.html) and [Marcelo Mattar](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/marcelo-mattar.html).
