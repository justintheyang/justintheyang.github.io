Hi, I'm Justin! I am a first-year PhD student in the Psychology department at Stanford University, advised by [Tobi Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/) and supported by the [NDSEG](https://ndseg.org/). I am interested in leveraging behavioral experiments and computational modeling to understand how we represent the world around us, how we simulate alternative worlds, and how we use these simulations to make inferences. 

At UCSD, I recieved degrees in Cognitive Science and Mathematics, and a minor in Computational Social Science. There I worked with [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/people.html) as a lab manager and with [Marcelo Mattar](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/marcelo-mattar.html) as an undergraduate thesis student. Before starting graduate school, I was a data scientist at Signifyd, where I built machine learning models to detect fraud in online orders.
